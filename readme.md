## Constructor and this keyword

```plaintext
what is the work of the constructor here?
in this situation why does the this inside onload be associated with AppHttp instance why not this.http? is it because of the constructor?


Great question! Let's break it down and focus on the behavior of `this` and the role of the `constructor` in this context.

### The Role of the Constructor:

The **constructor** in a JavaScript class is a special method used to initialize the instance of the class when it's created. When you create a new instance of `AppHttp` using `let http = new AppHttp()`, the `constructor` is called automatically to set up any properties and methods you define within it. In this case:

```js
class AppHttp {
    constructor() {
        this.http = new XMLHttpRequest();
    }
}
```

- `this.http = new XMLHttpRequest();` initializes a new instance of the `XMLHttpRequest` object and assigns it to the `http` property of the `AppHttp` instance.
- `this` inside the `constructor` refers to the **instance of `AppHttp`**, which is the object you created with `new AppHttp()`. So when you create an instance of `AppHttp`, `this.http` becomes an `XMLHttpRequest` instance inside the `AppHttp` object.

### The Issue with `this` Inside the `onload` Handler:

Now, let's focus on the key issue:

1. **Inside the `get` method**, when you assign the `onload` handler (`this.http.onload = function() {...}`), **the function you are assigning to `onload` is a regular function**. 

2. **The important thing to understand is how `this` works inside that regular function**. When you write a function in this form (non-arrow function), **the value of `this` is determined by how the function is called** — in this case, it's being called as an event handler for the `XMLHttpRequest` object.

   Specifically:
   - When the `onload` event of `XMLHttpRequest` is triggered, **`this` inside the `onload` callback refers to the `XMLHttpRequest` instance**, not the `AppHttp` instance.

   So when you do something like `this.http.status`, **`this` refers to the `XMLHttpRequest` object**, not the `AppHttp` instance that holds it. This causes issues because you are trying to access `this.http`, but inside the `onload` function, `this` is not referring to `AppHttp`.

3. **Why doesn't `this` inside `onload` refer to the `AppHttp` instance?**
   - It's because regular functions in JavaScript (like the one used in `onload`) don't **automatically preserve the value of `this`** from the outer scope. Instead, the `this` value is **re-bound** based on how the function is invoked. Since it's being invoked as part of the `XMLHttpRequest` object’s event (`onload`), `this` inside that function refers to the `XMLHttpRequest` object.

### Why Does `this` Inside `onload` Not Refer to the AppHttp Instance?

- When you write `this.http = new XMLHttpRequest();` in the **constructor**, you're setting up the `http` property on the **`AppHttp` instance**. So at this point, `this` refers to `AppHttp`.
- However, **inside the `onload` function**, `this` doesn't automatically refer to `AppHttp`. Instead, it refers to the object that **invoked** the function, which is the `XMLHttpRequest` object that triggered the `onload` event.

This is why `this` doesn't work as expected inside the `onload` handler. You want to access `this.http` (the `XMLHttpRequest`), but JavaScript loses track of the outer `AppHttp` context.

### How Arrow Functions Solve This:

When you use an **arrow function**, it doesn't create a new `this` context. Instead, it "inherits" or "captures" the `this` value from its surrounding context (which is the `AppHttp` instance in your case). This is why using an arrow function in `onload` works:

```js
this.http.onload = () => {
    if (this.http.status === 200) {
        let data = this.http.responseText;
        console.log(data);
    }
}
```

Here, the arrow function uses the `this` from the surrounding `get` method, which refers to the `AppHttp` instance, not the `XMLHttpRequest` instance.

### Summary:

- The `constructor` in this case initializes the `http` property on the `AppHttp` instance, but it doesn't control how `this` works inside the `onload` function.
- The `this` inside the `onload` function refers to the `XMLHttpRequest` object, not the `AppHttp` instance, because of how regular functions handle `this`.
- The `constructor` doesn't directly impact the `this` context inside the `onload` function, but it initializes the necessary property (`this.http`), which you want to use inside the handler.
- Using an **arrow function** preserves the `this` context from the `AppHttp` instance, allowing you to access `this.http` correctly.

I hope that clears things up! Let me know if you have any more questions.

## Question 2
```plaintext
how does the constructor initialize the http property on the AppHttp instance explain with examples

Sure! Let’s walk through how the **constructor** initializes the `http` property on the `AppHttp` instance with a step-by-step explanation and example.

### Understanding Constructors

In JavaScript, **constructors** are special functions that are used to initialize new objects created from a class. When you create an instance of a class using `new`, the constructor is called automatically.

### Constructor in the `AppHttp` Class

In the `AppHttp` class you provided:

```js
class AppHttp {
    constructor() {
        this.http = new XMLHttpRequest();
    }

    get(url) {
        this.http.open('GET', url, true);
        this.http.send();
        this.http.onload = () => {
            if (this.http.status === 200) {
                let data = this.http.responseText;
                console.log(data);
            }
        };
    }
}
```

- The `constructor()` is a special method inside the `AppHttp` class.
- Inside the constructor, `this.http = new XMLHttpRequest();` creates a new instance of the `XMLHttpRequest` object and assigns it to the `http` property of the `AppHttp` instance.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **When you create an instance of `AppHttp`**:

   ```js
   let myAppHttp = new AppHttp();
   ```

   - **The `new` keyword** creates a new instance of the `AppHttp` class.
   - The **constructor** is invoked immediately as part of this object creation process.

2. **Inside the constructor**:

   ```js
   this.http = new XMLHttpRequest();
   ```

   - `this` refers to the new instance of `AppHttp` that is being created (the object `myAppHttp`).
   - `this.http` is a property on the `AppHttp` instance (`myAppHttp`).
   - `new XMLHttpRequest()` creates a new instance of the `XMLHttpRequest` object, which is used to send HTTP requests (like `GET`, `POST`, etc.).

3. **What happens after initialization**:

   After the constructor is run, the `http` property on the `AppHttp` instance (`myAppHttp`) will be an instance of `XMLHttpRequest`. This means that the `myAppHttp` object will look something like this (conceptually):

   ```js
   myAppHttp = {
       http: XMLHttpRequest { /* XMLHttpRequest methods and properties */ }
   };
   ```

4. **Accessing the `http` property**:

   After the instance is created, you can access the `http` property like this:

   ```js
   console.log(myAppHttp.http); // Logs the XMLHttpRequest object
   ```

   You can now use this `http` property to send HTTP requests or manipulate the `XMLHttpRequest` object.

### Example: Initializing and Using `http`:

Let’s say you want to send a request using `myAppHttp`. Here’s how that works:

```js
let myAppHttp = new AppHttp();  // Create an instance of AppHttp

// Access the http property and use it to make a request
myAppHttp.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
```

When `myAppHttp.get()` is called:

1. Inside the `get` method, `this.http` refers to the `XMLHttpRequest` object that was created in the constructor. The `get` method calls methods like `open()` and `send()` on `this.http`, which are methods of the `XMLHttpRequest` object.
   
2. The `onload` event handler is set up to run when the request is completed, and inside this handler, `this.http` refers to the same `XMLHttpRequest` instance, allowing you to access `this.http.status` and `this.http.responseText` to handle the response.

### Why Does `this.http` Exist on the `AppHttp` Instance?

- The `this` keyword in JavaScript refers to the **current instance** of the object.
- The constructor (`constructor()`) is where you initialize properties and methods on the instance.
- By doing `this.http = new XMLHttpRequest();`, you’re creating an `XMLHttpRequest` object and attaching it as a property (`http`) to the current instance (`AppHttp`).

### Example with Full Code:

Here’s a complete example with the steps explained:

```js
class AppHttp {
    constructor() {
        // The constructor initializes the 'http' property
        this.http = new XMLHttpRequest();
    }

    // Method to send a GET request using the 'http' property
    get(url) {
        // Access 'this.http' to use the XMLHttpRequest
        this.http.open('GET', url, true);
        this.http.send();
        
        // Setting up an onload event handler for when the request completes
        this.http.onload = () => {
            if (this.http.status === 200) {
                // If status is 200 (OK), log the response
                let data = this.http.responseText;
                console.log(data);
            }
        };
    }
}

// Creating an instance of AppHttp
let myAppHttp = new AppHttp();  // Constructor is called here

// Now we can use 'myAppHttp' to make a GET request
myAppHttp.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
```

### Key Points:

- **Constructor's role**: The constructor’s role is to initialize the properties and methods of an object when it is created. In this case, the constructor initializes the `http` property to be an `XMLHttpRequest` instance.
- **`this.http`**: This is a reference to the `XMLHttpRequest` object attached to the current instance of the `AppHttp` class. It allows you to interact with the HTTP request and response.
- **Accessing `http`**: After the instance is created, you can call methods like `get()` to interact with the `http` property and make HTTP requests.

### Conclusion:

- The constructor initializes the `http` property on the `AppHttp` instance by creating a new `XMLHttpRequest` object and assigning it to `this.http`.
- You can then use `this.http` within methods (like `get()`) to send HTTP requests and interact with the response.

I hope this explanation clears up how the constructor initializes the `http` property! Let me know if you need more examples or further explanation.
